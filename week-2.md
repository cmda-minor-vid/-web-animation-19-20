## Lab

### Transitions in Space

> Add interactivity based on user input

#### Synopsis

- **Time**: 16:00h
- **Due**: before _lecture 3_

#### Description

Your artwork should respond to input from the user. Use transitions, animation, pseudo-classes and events to make your artwork interactive. What happens when people hover over certain elements with their mouse? What if they press keys on their keyboard?

- Can the user `:hover` over certain elements with their mouse?
- What happens when the user tries to use a keyboard?
- Should something happen when you scroll the page?
- Do you need JavaScript to listen for events?
